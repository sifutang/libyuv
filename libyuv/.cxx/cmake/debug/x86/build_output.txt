Could NOT find JPEG (missing: JPEG_LIBRARY JPEG_INCLUDE_DIR) 
CMake Warning (dev) at /home/android/AndroidStudioProjects/Libyuv/libyuv/src/main/cpp/libyuv/CMakeLists.txt:45 (if):
  Policy CMP0064 is not set: Support new TEST if() operator.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0064" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

  TEST will be interpreted as an operator when the policy is set to NEW.
  Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior will be used.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
